Steps:

1. Set intial time, altitude, and dt, and velocity
Create an expansion ratio array
 
    In overall for loop (for one expansion ratio, loop simulates)
    2. Update time step t=t +dt
    3. Calculate mass of propellant burned
    4. Get instantaneous rocket mass
    5. Solve for air density based off previous altitude (yi-1)
    6. Set up Thrust force function
    7. Set up drag force function
    8. Combine terms for Fnet = Ft-Fd-Winst
    9. Get instantaneous acceleration --> Fnet/instantaneous mass
    10. Get velocity: Vnew = Vold + Ainst*dt
    11. Get altitude: Ynew = Yold + Vnew*dt
    12. Store velocity and postion data
    13. Repeat Loop

Loop will iterate once again for new expansion ratio


Check shock locations and ensure shock expansion ratio is greater than actual nozzle expansion ratio (Design for second critical)
