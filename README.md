#### HALE_Nozzle ####

Welcome,

This repository catalogues work for a bell style de Laval rocket nozzle designed for
the Oregon State University High Altitude Liquid Engine (HALE) Rocket Team. HALE is a
team competing in the Base 11 Space Challenge. Mira is the first liquid engine to be 
developed at OSU. Mira is a 2000 lbf pressure-fed LOx/Kerosene engine. 

Jacob Van De Lindt and Peter Strohmaier are currently designing this nozzle for the 
first subscale liquid rocket the HALE team will launch. Rao's method will be utilized
to generate the contour of the bell nozzle. The repository serves as a place for us to 
share our computations and simulations as we make progress on the nozzle project.
